Installation
------------

The installation of this library can be done with Composer:

.. code-block::

    composer require aplus/date

Date
----

The Date class adds some functionality to the native **DateTime** class.

It implements the **JsonSerializable** and **Stringable** interfaces,
optimizing work with APIs by transforming the Date object into a string in ATOM
format.

Example using the ``__toString`` method:

.. code-block:: php

    use Framework\Date\Date;

    $date = new Date();
    echo $date; // 2019-11-08T15:40:57-03:00

Humanize
########

With objects of the Date class it is possible to render time spaces that are
easier for humans to understand. For this, use the ``humanize`` method:

.. code-block:: php

    echo $date->humanize(); // 3 days ago

It can also be in another language:

.. code-block:: php

    $language = new Language('pt-br');
    $date->setLanguage($language);
    echo $date->humanize(); // 3 dias atr√°s

Conclusion
----------

Aplus Date Library is an easy-to-use tool for, beginners and experienced, PHP developers. 
It is perfect for working with APIs that need date manipulation. 
The more you use it, the more you will learn.
